CC2530 ZNP radio driver

2. Known issues
   ZNP serial API seems not supporting the following features currently:
   (1) AF multi-cast data request (corrected, it could support by AF_DATA_REQ_EXT)
       There is a AF_DATA_REQUEST only for unicast or broadcast. Just like XBee! Why do they always do things in a wrong way!
       After reviewing the ZNP source code, the MT_AfDataRequest() in MT_AF.c could be modified to support multicast data
       request and the frame format should be also modified. Maybe creating a new frame type is better.
   (2) Group management
       Group management is not exposed through ZDO interface. 
       ZCL support need be added. 
   (3) Default transport interface
       The default transport interface is SPI enabled in hal_board_cfg.h.
       Ln92~93 should be modified to enable UART.
       Flow control should be disabled for USB-serial adapter usage in function
       znpInit() located in znp_app.c file.
   (4) Simple_Desc_rsp with wrong data [fixed]:
       We set 0x5A via Z-tool, but when send request we got the response with DeviceVer=0xA0.
       We set 0x02 via Z-tool, but when send request we got the response with DeviceVer=0x20.
       
       Seems there is some bit shift error either in Z-tool or Z-stack firmware.
       After checking the document, the version value takes higher 4bits of DeviceVer returned.
       The value range is 0x01~0x0f. SO there is no error. Zpi code updated for this.
